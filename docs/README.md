dsd-plugin-generator documentation
---

I'll probably make a full documentation site on read the docs before long for this project, but for now the most important information is in the main README and here.

- [Plugin structure](plugin_structure.md): This page describes the structure of a plugin, and the naming conventions used.
- [End to end tests](e2e_tests.md): This page describes how the end to end tests are set up, and how they can be used for development purposes as well as for testing purposes.
