1.0 - Stable release
---

This series corresponds to 1.x releases of django-simple-deploy.

### 1.3.0

#### External changes

- Adds supoort for custom CLI args in the generated plugin. Code that would actually implement a custom arg is commented out, but it should be relatively straightforward for plugin authors to use this code to extend the core CLI.

#### Internal changes

- Instantiate plugin_config in plugin_config.py.
- Adds infrastructure for supporting custom CLI args: cli.py, hook impls.
- Updated integration test reference files to reflect this new plugin structure.
- E2e tests exercise a custom CLI arg by uncommenting code from the generated plugin.
- E2e tests verify that custom CLI arg help is included in the main --help output.
- Prints output of tests run in a subprocess.
- Checks for `FAILED` in output, not `100%`.
- Updated docs.

### 1.1.0

#### External changes

- Uses plugin name with underscores for main source code directory.
- Document project structure and naming conventions.
- Document e2e tests.
- E2e test supports CLI arg `--setup-plugins-only`, which sets up a django-simple-deploy develop environment in a temp test location with numerous freshly-generated plugins. It does not run any tests. These resources can be examined, or copied to a more stable location for more extensive development and testing.

#### Internal changes

- Restructure e2e tests to use fixtures.
- In e2e tests, use independent tests for each test plugin.
